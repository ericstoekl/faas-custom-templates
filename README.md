## faas-custom-templates

This is a CLI for use with [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) - a serverless functions framework for Docker & Kubernetes.

> Before using this tool please setup OpenFaaS by following instructions over on the main repo.

The CLI can be used to build and deploy functions to [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas). You can build OpenFaaS functions from a set of supported language templates (such as Node.js, Python, CSharp and Ruby). That means you just write a handler file such as (handler.py/handler.js) and the CLI does the rest to create a Docker image.
